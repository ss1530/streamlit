Began a year ago - intermitent coughing when excited or when going on a walk. Coughs every day. Not distressed or ill. Enjoys exercise. Spasms, probably productive. No frank exercise intolerance. However; 'Sometimes at the end of a walk she looks a bit puffed-out and knackered.' No collapsing episodes. DUDE. Rarely sneezes.  Ref VS notes confirm history. seem to suggest upper resp disease / tracheitis or tracheal collapse as most likely cause. Ref VS radiographs mostly expiratory quality rather poor. Suggest right-sided cardiomegaly but all are expiratory films.  On the best right lateral view the cardiac silhouette appears to show right ventricular enlargement even though the VHS is normal 5.3 + 5.3 = 10.6. On the DV view the cardiothoracic index is definitely increased (ie. 80% ref < 66%).  Recently <<name>> had GA and dental incl removal of many teeth - this was when the radiography was done.  BAR. BCS 7/9. Dog makes loud upper resp noise. Good colour. Reasonable pulses. Proptosis and minor conjunctivitis. HR 116. No frank murmurs. Some adventitous resp noise. T 38.6oC. Remaining teeth look good. Fidgety - would not allow full dental / oral exam conscious.  VERY easy to induce a loud series of harsh productive coughing causing some mild distress.  Discussed with client: this dog is difficult to medicate and is not frankly unwell. Disease does not seem progressive. Is detailed investigation really justified? Negotiated with <<name>>: She is understandably reluctant to over-investigate. Also medicating this dog is difficult. The radiographs definitely suggest right-sided cardiomegaly. But the history and clinical findings are not highly suggestive of heart disease.  Plan: Echocardiography / ECG alone initially. Owner mobile: <<phone>>. Echo: Good quality study although the dog is wriggly and fidgetty. Normal sinus rhythm throuout. No evidence of vavlular incompetencies or stenosis, normal myocardial function, no frank chamber enlargement. No pulmonary hypertension of other evidence to indicate serious pulmonary disease.  Plan: Diagnosis is open but clinical signs suggest probable tracheitis / bronchitis. This may have been partly or wholly induced by chronic dental disease. It is unlikely to be progressive or fatal.
