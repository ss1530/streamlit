Area clipped over the mass. FNA mass, 4 slides taken. explained to owner that FNAs are not always diagnostic, may come back as inconclusive. Owner aware and happy to go ahead with sending for analysis. If continues not to eat then to bring back in. May be inflammatory, unlikely neoplastic, gland hyperplasia?

Has been having diet as usual but been less active as has been scared and not going outside so much, also been attacking owner more. Adv when scared to just let him run away dont try and keep him there - has a safe place in garage that he runs to, let him come back out of his own accord. Adv feliway in sitting room - o has one at home so will use again. Likes a ball toy o found so is playing with that - keep on doing so. Adv dont force him outsiode at the moment as is obviously scared will make situation worse. Not sure what scared him but there is a lot of new neighboiurs and building works going on so could be any number of things. Had a good feel over today and no sore points but adv o to keep an eye out for any lameness as due to weight he is at greater risk of arthritis and this could make him attack o if sore.
